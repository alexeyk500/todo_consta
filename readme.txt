You need locally installed Docker,
if you have Docker on your local machine:

1) clone the project by command $ git clone https://github.com/alexeyk500/todo_consta.git
2) go to the project folder by command $ cd todo_consta
3) build and start project by command $ docker-compose up -d

The todo_consta will start on http://localhost

To stop project use command $docker-compose down
